## üìú Introduction

In today's digital landscape, cybersecurity is crucial. Cyber threats evolve rapidly, making it essential to have robust systems in place for detection and response. This project aims to provide a solution for detecting attacks in network traffic through machine learning. 

The system analyzes traffic patterns and identifies anomalies that may indicate malicious activity. By using machine learning, it learns from past data to improve its detection capabilities over time.

## ‚ú® Features

- **Automated Detection**: Automatically identifies malicious traffic patterns.
- **Classification**: Classifies different types of attacks.
- **Interactive Menu**: User-friendly interface for easy navigation.
- **JSON Report**: Generates detailed reports in JSON format for further analysis.
- **Machine Learning Algorithms**: Utilizes Random Forest for accurate threat detection.
- **Network Security**: Enhances the security of network systems.

## üõ†Ô∏è Technologies Used

This project incorporates various technologies and tools, including:

- **Python**: The primary programming language for development.
- **Machine Learning Libraries**: 
  - `scikit-learn` for implementing machine learning algorithms.
  - `pandas` for data manipulation.
  - `numpy` for numerical computations.
- **Visualization**: 
  - `matplotlib` and `seaborn` for visualizing data and results.
- **JSON**: For report generation and data interchange.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Usage

Once you have installed the project, you can start using it. Run the main script:

```bash
python main.py
```

You will see an interactive menu guiding you through the available options. You can choose to analyze network traffic or generate reports based on previous analyses.

## üîç How It Works

The system works by analyzing network traffic data. Here's a brief overview of the process:

1. **Data Collection**: Gather network traffic data, which can be in various formats.
2. **Preprocessing**: Clean and prepare the data for analysis.
3. **Feature Extraction**: Identify relevant features that can help in classifying traffic.
4. **Model Training**: Train the Random Forest model using historical data.
5. **Detection**: Use the trained model to detect anomalies in real-time traffic.
6. **Reporting**: Generate a JSON report summarizing the findings.

## üìä Report Generation

After running the detection, the system generates a JSON report. This report includes:

- Detected threats
- Classification of attacks
- Recommendations for mitigation

You can find the report in the `reports` directory after execution.
